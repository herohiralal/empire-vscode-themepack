# Empire VSCode ThemePack

## Motivation

Inspired by editor look of [oh-lucy](https://github.com/hermitter/oh-lucy-vscode-theme) and token colours of [one monokai](https://github.com/azemoh/vscode-one-monokai/).

## empire-monokai-light

## How to Edit

Customizable. Change the colors in `empire-color.mjs` & run `npm run build` to build
the theme.

Themes will be built in `temp/`. Pick up the `colors` section from it and paste in empire-monokai themes.

More to come soon.

To apply your customized theme copy `themes/` folder to
`~/.vscode/extensions`.
